# SuiLotto — A Multi-Winner On-Chain Lottery on Sui

## Project Overview

SuiLotto is a decentralized lottery protocol built on the Sui blockchain. Players purchase tickets by depositing SUI tokens into a shared prize pool. When the lottery deadline is reached, random winners are selected on-chain using Sui's native randomness module. The number of winners scales with participation — more players means more winners! Winners share 98% of the prize pool equally, while 2% goes to the protocol as a fee.

The lottery leverages Sui's unique features including the object-centric model for managing lottery state, shared objects for permissionless participation, and native VRF (Verifiable Random Function) for provably fair winner selection.

## Rules

### Basic Mechanics

1. An admin creates a lottery round by setting a ticket price and deadline
2. Players buy tickets by paying the exact ticket price in SUI — each payment equals one ticket
3. Players can buy unlimited tickets to increase their winning odds
4. At least 2 participants are required for a valid draw
5. After the deadline, the admin triggers the draw
6. Winners are randomly selected — probability proportional to tickets held
7. Winners share 98% of the prize pool equally, 2% goes to protocol

### Winner Tiers

The number of winners scales with ticket count:

| Tickets Sold | Winners | Prize per Winner (of 98%) |
| ------------ | ------- | ------------------------- |
| 2-5          | 1       | 100%                      |
| 6-9          | 2       | 50% each                  |
| 10-99        | 3       | ~33.3% each               |
| 100+         | 5       | 20% each                  |

**Note:** Same address CAN win multiple times if they hold multiple tickets. Each ticket is a separate entry in the draw.

### Roles

| Role   | Permissions                                         |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Admin  | Create lottery rounds, trigger draws after deadline |
| Player | Purchase tickets while lottery is active            |

### Prize Distribution

| Recipient        | Share |
| ---------------- | ----- |
| Winners          | 98%   |
| Protocol (Admin) | 2%    |

### Lottery States

| State     | Description                                          |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Active    | Accepting ticket purchases, deadline not yet reached |
| Completed | Winners selected, funds distributed                  |

### Constraints

- **Minimum Players**: 2 participants required for a valid draw
- **Deadline**: Set upfront at lottery creation, enforced on-chain
- **Refunds**: Available if deadline passes with fewer than 2 participants

### Randomness

Winner selection uses Sui's native `sui::random` module, providing verifiable on-chain randomness that cannot be manipulated by any party including the admin. The `draw_winner` function is marked as `entry` (not `public`) to prevent composition attacks on the randomness.
